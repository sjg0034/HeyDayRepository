## What is Hey Day?
"Hey Day" is a tradition at Auburn University where students wear nametags and greet each other. This is a day held annually to help students feel a sense of belonging on campus and to encourage the feeling of the "Auburn family" at the university. This helps make a big campus feel more inclusive. If you want to learn more about "Hey Day" and how the tradition got started, please go to this [link](http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/).
